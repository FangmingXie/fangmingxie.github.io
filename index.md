[Here](https://brainome.ucsd.edu/BICCN_MOp) is some data of mouse brain cell transcriptomes and epigenomes, which displays the DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression profiles of 56 neuronal cell types identified from >400,000 single cells from the mouse primary motor cortex. More details are in [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03500-8) and [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03950-0) papers in *Nature*, where I developed [SingleCellFusion](https://github.com/mukamel-lab/SingleCellFusion), a computational tool for the integrative analysis of brain cell transcriptomes and epigenomes.
